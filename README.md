Proof of concept for porting joind.in to Symfony2
=================================================

Todo:
* Move all the views to nice looking twig templates
* Identify all the business logic and convert into code
* Define all the currently used routing
* Correctly set the relations between the entities
* Probably we want to change the current entity field names as well
* All the rest I forgot
