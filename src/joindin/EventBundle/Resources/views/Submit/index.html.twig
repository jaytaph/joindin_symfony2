        <h4>Submission Tips & Terms</h4>
        <div class="ctn">
            <p>Here's a few useful definitions when submitting events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Stub</b>: The stub is the shortcut in the URL to access
                your event. For example, in https://joind.in/event/test123 the
                "test123" part is the stub.
                <li><b>Event Admin</b>: If you're an organizer of an event or
                want to be listed as an administrator, check the "I'm an event
                admin!" checkbox.
                <li><b>Private Events</b>: A private event is invite-only. Event
                admins for private events can either send out or approve requests
                for invites.
                <li><b>Call for Papers</b>: If your event is going to have a time for
                session submissions, check the box and specify the range. This will
                show in the event detail page.
            </ul>
        </div>
